# Attrition-Prediction
### In this project, I used a dataset of employees with several features like their age, department, daily rate, frequency of buisness travel etc. There are a total of 35 columns in this. There are 1470 entries in this dataset.
### I sourced this dataset from kaggle. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelprashant/employee-attrition
### Using the available features, we predict the attrition of employees.
### We analyse how the different features affect the attrition.
### Then we use the Logistic Regression algorithm and the Gradient Descent to build a predictive model based on the features that have high correlation with the target variable.
